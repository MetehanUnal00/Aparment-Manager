## Important Backend Alignment Notes

### Critical Field Mappings
1. **Contract Response Fields**: 
   - Backend uses `isCurrentlyActive`, frontend was using `isActive` - FIXED
   - Backend uses `canBeRenewed/canBeModified/canBeCancelled`, frontend was using `canRenew/canModify/canCancel` - FIXED
   - Backend has `hasRenewal` field to check if contract was renewed

2. **Date Handling**:
   - All dates from backend come as ISO strings (LocalDate/LocalDateTime)
   - Frontend uses string type for all dates
   - Need to handle date conversions in service layer

3. **Monetary Values**:
   - Backend uses BigDecimal for all money fields
   - Frontend uses number type
   - Need to ensure proper decimal handling

4. **Enum Handling**:
   - ContractExpiryNotification.urgencyLevel comes as string from backend, not enum
   - Need to handle string-to-enum conversion if needed

5. **Missing Backend Features in Frontend**:
   - ModificationReason enum was completely missing - ADDED
   - Several fields in ContractModificationRequest were missing - ADDED
   - Security deposit fields in renewal request - ADDED

## Notes

- Mark items with âœ… when complete
- Add notes about blockers or issues
- Update estimates if needed
- Communicate progress daily
