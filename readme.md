Okay, this is a great point to pause and outline the project structure and plan in more detail. Having clear documentation for data models, API design, user flows, and a way to track progress with story points is crucial for a successful project.

Let's break these down:

## Apartment Management System - Project Documentation
### 1. Data Models (Entities)
These will be our primary JPA entities in the Spring Boot backend.

- User
  
  - id (Long, Primary Key, Auto-generated)
  - username (String, Unique, Not Null) - Could be email
  - password (String, Not Null, Encrypted)
  - firstName (String)
  - lastName (String)
  - email (String, Unique, Not Null)
  - role (String, e.g., "ROLE_MANAGER", "ROLE_TENANT") - We might simplify to just "MANAGER" initially and expand later if needed.
  - createdAt (Timestamp)
  - updatedAt (Timestamp)
- ApartmentBuilding (Represents the entire apartment complex/building if managing multiple)
  
  - id (Long, Primary Key, Auto-generated)
  - name (String, Not Null, e.g., "Sunshine Apartments")
  - address (String)

    , OneToMany relationship, mappedBy apartmentBuilding )

### 2. API Designs (High-Level)
All endpoints will be prefixed with /api . We'll use JWT for authentication.

- Authentication ( /api/auth )
  
  - POST /login : { username, password } -> { jwtToken, userDetails }
  - POST /register : { username, password, email, firstName, lastName } -> Success/Error message (Initially for manager, tenant registration can be added later)
- Users ( /api/users ) (Primarily for manager, if tenants have accounts)
  
  - GET /me : (Requires Auth) -> { userDetails }
- Apartment Buildings ( /api/apartment-buildings ) (If managing multiple buildings)
  
  - POST / : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) { name, address } -> { apartmentBuildingDetails }
  - GET / : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> List
  - GET /{id} : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> { apartmentBuildingDetails }
  - PUT /{id} : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) { name, address } -> { updatedApartmentBuildingDetails }
  - DELETE /{id} : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> Success/Error
- Flats ( /api/flats )
  
  - POST / : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) { flatNumber, apartmentBuildingId (if applicable), monthlyRent, tenant: { firstName, lastName, contactNumber, email (optional) } } -> { flatDetailsIncludingTenant }
  - GET / : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> List
    (with query params for filtering, e.g., ?buildingId=X ) (Response should include tenant summary)
  - GET /debtors : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> List
    (Response should include tenant summary)
  - GET /{id} : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> { flatDetailsIncludingTenant }
  - PUT /{id} : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) { flatNumber, monthlyRent, tenant: { firstName, lastName, contactNumber, email (optional) } } -> { updatedFlatDetailsIncludingTenant }
  - DELETE /{id} : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> Success/Error (Consider implications for the tenant record - e.g., disassociate or soft delete tenant)
- Payments ( /api/payments )
  
  - POST / : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) { flatId, amount, paymentDate, paymentForMonth, paymentMethod } -> { paymentDetails }
  - GET / : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> List
    (with query params for filtering, e.g., ?flatId=X&month=Y&year=Z )
  - GET /{id} : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> { paymentDetails }
  - PUT /{id} : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) { amount, paymentDate, paymentForMonth, paymentMethod } -> { updatedPaymentDetails } (Use with caution, usually payments are not edited)
  - DELETE /{id} : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> Success/Error (Use with caution)
- Expenses ( /api/expenses )
  
  - POST / : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) { description, amount, expenseDate, category } -> { expenseDetails }
  - GET / : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> List
    (with query params for filtering, e.g., ?category=X&startDate=Y&endDate=Z )
  - GET /{id} : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> { expenseDetails }
  - PUT /{id} : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) { description, amount, expenseDate, category } -> { updatedExpenseDetails }
  - DELETE /{id} : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> Success/Error
- Monthly Dues ( /api/monthly-dues )
  
  - POST /generate : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) (Potentially takes month/year or runs for current month) -> Status of generation
  - GET / : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> List
    (with query params for filtering, e.g., ?flatId=X&month=Y&year=Z&isPaid=false )
- Dashboard ( /api/dashboard )
  
  - GET /summary : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) -> { totalIncomeThisMonth, totalExpensesThisMonth, outstandingDuesCount, etc. }
  - GET /income-expense-graph : (Requires Auth: MANAGER) { query params for period } -> { data for graph }
### 3. User Flows
- Manager Login Flow:
  
  1. User (Manager) navigates to the login page.
  2. Enters username and password.
  3. System authenticates credentials.
  4. If successful, JWT is issued, and the user is redirected to the Dashboard.
  5. If unsuccessful, an error message is displayed.
- Manager Registers a New Flat:
  
  1. Manager logs in.
  2. Navigates to "Flats Management" or "Register New Flat" section.
  3. Fills in flat details (number, monthly rent/dues) and tenant details (first name, last name, contact number, email).
  4. Submits the form.
  5. System saves the new flat and associated tenant to the database.
  6. Confirmation message is shown.
- Manager Records a Payment:
  
  1. Manager logs in.
  2. Navigates to "Payments" or "Dashboard" (where debtors might be listed).
  3. Selects a flat (which will show associated tenant information).
  4. Clicks "Record Payment".
  5. Enters payment details (amount, date, month paid for, method).
  6. Submits the form.
  7. System saves the payment, potentially updates the MonthlyDue status.
  8. Confirmation message is shown. List of debtors/dues is updated.
- Manager Records an Expense:
  
  1. Manager logs in.
  2. Navigates to "Expense Management".
  3. Clicks "Record New Expense".
  4. Enters expense details (description, amount, date, category).
  5. Submits the form.
  6. System saves the expense.
  7. Confirmation message is shown. Expense list/graphs are updated.
- Manager Views Dashboard:
  
  1. Manager logs in.
  2. Is directed to the Dashboard.
  3. Dashboard displays:
     - List of debtors (flats with outstanding dues).
     - Summary of income/expenses.
     - Graphs visualizing income vs. expenses.
  4. Manager can navigate from the dashboard to other sections.
- System Generates Monthly Dues:
  
  1. This can be a scheduled task or manually triggered by the manager.
  2. System iterates through all registered flats.
  3. For each flat, it creates a MonthlyDue record for the current/specified month with the monthlyRent amount.
  4. These dues appear as outstanding until a payment covering them is recorded.
### 4. Story Points (Feature Breakdown for Estimation)
Story points are relative estimates of effort. Here's a breakdown of features that would typically become user stories. The actual points (e.g., using Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) would be assigned by the development team.

This detailed breakdown should provide a good roadmap. Remember that the "Story Points" section is a list of features to be estimated; the actual point values are placeholders for team discussion.

We can now proceed with implementing these, starting with the User entity and basic authentication. What would you like to tackle first?
